#To run the job daily or at certain time during the day, we used cron job

First you will need to execute in the unix system:
crontab -e

An editor will open where you can enter the following:

MAILTO=flora_ripudaman@hotmail.com
*/57 18 * * * python <path to your python script>

where 57 is a minute, and 18 is an hour

MAILTO option is optional

If you want to pipe the output to the file, you can do that via the following:
*/57 18 * * * python <path to your python script> >> /tmp/blah.txt

where /tmp/blah.txt could be any directory where you would like to store the log.
